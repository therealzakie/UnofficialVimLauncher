- Make sure **git** is installed. If not, try installing git ([Windows Systems](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest)) ([Linux Systems](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux)) ([Macintosh Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-git-on-mac/))
- Open **Terminal** or **Command Line (cmd)**.
- Run ```git clone https://github.com/therealzakie/UnofficialVimLauncher.git```. This will grab EVERYTHING in this repository and place it in your currently selected directory.
- Then Run ```cd UnofficialVimLauncher``` and ```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py```.

### (Alternative) ```.pkg``` file for MacOS:
- Make sure your MacOS system can open ```.pkg``` files.
- Open [Unofficial Vim Launcher.pkg](https://github.com/therealzakie/UnofficialVimLauncher/blob/master/Unofficial%20Vim%20Launcher.pkg) to begin the installation.
- Go through the steps to install ```Unofficial Vim Launcher.app```.
- **If saved for all users of the computer, go to your ```Applications``` folder inside of your startup disk or ```/```.**
- **If saved for only this user, go to your home folder (the folder with your username) then go to ```Applications```.**
